RN-Integrate supports react-native 0.78 out-of-the-box. Simply follow [upgrade docs](/docs/upgrade) once to make your project upgradable. After that you can then upgrade to any React Native version easily.

Please open an issue for unsupported modules that require additional changes. I will be happy to assist creating a config for it.

Happy coding!
