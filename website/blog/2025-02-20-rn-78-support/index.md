RN-Integrate supports react-native 0.78 out-of-the-box. Simply follow [upgrade docs](/docs/upgrade) once to make your project upgradable. You can then upgrade to any React Native version with a single command!

Please open an issue for unsupported modules that require additional changes. I will happily assist with creating a config for it.

Happy coding!
